== LAB SETUP :: These have already been done  

* SOFTWARE
** The Arduino IDE has been installed on the lab system. 
*** This can be found online at https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
**** Version 1.8.1 was installed
** The Arduino IDE has been configured to pick up the ESP8266 board definition by adding 'http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json' to 'File->Preferences->Settings' “Additional Boards Manager URLS”.
*** http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.3.0/doc/installing.html
** Arduino libraries and ESP8266 specific libraries have been installed
*** In the Arduino IDE, Click on 'Sketch->Include Libraries->Manage Libraries' 
**** http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.3.0/doc/libraries.html
**** The following libraries have been installed:
***** ESP8266
***** Adafruit MQTT Library
***** DHT Sensor library by Adafruit
***** Adafruit Unified Sensor by Adafruit (dependency of DHT Sensor)
*** ESP8266 Arduino reference doc
**** http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.3.0/
** The mosquitto MQTT broker has been installed. This can be found online at https://mosquitto.org/download/ or by using “apt-get mosquitto”.
** The Node-RED flow manager software has been installed. Instructions on how to do this can be found at https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation .
* HARDWARE
** A NodeMCU ESP8266 development board has been mounted on a breadboardand wired up to a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor.
*** NodeMCU ESP8266 v1.0
**** https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0
*** DHT11 breakout board
**** The + pin of the DHT11 goes to 3v3
**** The – pin of the DHT11 goes to GND
**** The OUT pin of the DHT11 goes to D5

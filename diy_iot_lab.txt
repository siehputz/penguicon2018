.ESP8266 Arduino IDE , sensor,  Data Broker and Web Server Basics
Lab 1 :: Familiarize yourself with the Arduino IDE, compiling, and uploading a program to the ESP8266
Lab 2 :: Program the ESP8266 to gather and report DHT11 data from a sensor
Lab 3 :: Program the ESP8266 to publish to a MQTT Broker
Lab 4 :: Program the ESP8266 to publish DHT11 Temperature sensor data to a MQTT Broker
Lab 5 :: Program the ESP8266 to be a Web Server 
Lab 6 :: Program the ESP8266 to be a Access Point and a Web Server 
Lab 7 :: Program the ESP8266 to display DHT11 sensor data via a local web server as a Access Point

.Optional labs if time permits
.Data Flow with Node-RED
Lab 8 :: Familiarize yourself with Node-RED
Lab 9 :: Setup ESP8266 to publish to MQTT Broker, and configure a Node-RED flow to subscribe to MQTT and send email 

.ESP8266 No/Little Programming Frameworks 
Lab 10 :: Upload and configure ESPeasy to send DHT11 sensor data to MQTT Broker 

.Final Step
LAB 11 :: Configure a Node-Red flow to subscribe to a MQTT broker and publish to the cloud
